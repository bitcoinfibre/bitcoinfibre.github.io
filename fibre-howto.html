								<hr>

								<p>The Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine (FIBRE) codebase is designed as an extension to Bitcoin Core which allows it to allow for very fast relay with manually selected peers over UDP. It has not (yet) been updated for SegWit's recent merge, but is based on Bitcoin Core immediately prior to it. Note that it currently has a different license than the rest of Bitcoin Core which is much more restrictive.</p>
								<p>To run it, run Bitcoin Core as you normally would, with the version from <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinfibre/bitcoinfibre">the FIBRE github</a> (a dependency on yasm for asm-based SHA256 has been added). Add the -udpport option to the command line or bitcoin.conf, set to an unfiltered UDP port on which communication will take place. For each peer, either add a -trustedudpnode or -addudpnode option to the command line or bitcoin.conf, or add them at runtime using the addudpnode RPC command.<br><br>By default, outbound bandwidth usage will be a constant 1Gbps when transmitting (a few MB per block), and thus it should generally be run with a network which can support this. For slower networks, the `target_bytes_per_sec` constant in src/ udpnet.cpp can be tweaked accordingly. Note, of course, that if the latency between two peers is similar to the time required to transmit a few hundred KB (ie you have very low bandwidth available), using regular compact blocks may be faster.<br><br>Note that the FIBRE codebase is still relatively new, and while has been incredibly stable in testing, bugs should be expected, and detailed benchmarking and optimization would be much appreciated.<br>
								</p>

								<p class="lead">Node settings</p>
								<p>There is a distinction between how we relay packets between "trusted nodes" and "untrusted nodes". Due to the nature of our FEC encoding, we cannot know if individual packets are a part of a legitimate block (or even part of a block), and thus relaying them on to our other peers before we have reconstructed that block would both waste our own bandwidth (potentially at the same time as we want to be relaying a legitimate block) and potentially break block reconstruction. However, for those running a network with multiple nodes around the world, it is reasonable for those servers to trust each other. For such networks, packets from "trusted nodes" will immediately be relayed on to all other peers, adding almost no overhead for additional nodes.
								</p>

								<p>The FIBRE codebase is fully-tested with IPv6 and also works well through NAT. As long as both peers add each other as UDP peers using their public IPs, most NAT routers will automatically add the required entries to the NAT table and packets will flow normally (obvious caveats about using FIBRE on low-bandwidth connections apply).
								</p>

								<p class="lead">How to Know It's Working</p>
								<p>Logging in the FIBRE codebase is accomplished through the standard Bitcoin Core debug.log. Some additional log entries are generated with -debug=bench and -debug=udpnet.&nbsp;A sample log for block relay might look like this (with comments at the end of lines on what they represent):</p>

								<p>There is code to build a stats page similar to the one at the stats page, which could be made generic with some effort. If folks are interested, please contact me.
		Please keep in mind, when analyzing times, that clocks on most hosts on the internet can differ by hundreds of milliseconds thanks to NTP's inability to handle path-asymmetry and inconsistent upstream clocks. If you have reliable path-symmetry and are on physical hardware, it is highly recommended that you use NTP's "peer" option and monitor NTP sync stats to get better clock sync.</p>

								<p class="lead">Server Selection</p>
								<p>
									The most important part of setting up a relay network, after you have an efficient relay software stack, is selection of the servers which run relay nodes. If done right, there is no need to spend more than $50-200/month or so on nodes, though if you're lazy and have cash to burn you can ignore most of this section and give your local NTT/Sprint/PCCW/etc representative a call.
								</p>
								<p class="lead">General Hosting Notes</p>
								<p>Because FIBRE is an extension of Bitcoin Core, the basic requirements for running Bitcoin Core should be met with any host selected. Of course if you're hosting on a cheap ARM board, you shouldn't expect to see stellar performance anyway, so use of fast-relay technology would be a strange choice. <br><br>Generally, any host which can run Bitcoin Core and process blocks in a second or two will be sufficient to see some gains over long-haul links with this codebase.
								<br><br>Because this is a latency-optimized service and not a general performance-optimized one, it is highly recommended that you disable SWAP, at least for the bitcoind process. Additionally, note that VPSes often have latency spikes due to virtualisation overhead, noisy neighbors, network interface poll frequency, and uncontrollable SWAP usage. Even still, if 100ms spikes are acceptable, well-selected VPSes will generally do just fine.
								<br><br>Keep in mind that there is often little advantage in using "big-name" hosting for systems like this. Cheaper, smaller hosting providers are often more willing to accommodate strange requests, which can be of significant help.</p>
								<p class="lead">Common Routing Issues</p>
								<p>Obviously one of the most important elements in block transmission latency is the latency of packets between hosts in the network. Sadly, the internet is a tangled cobweb of strange routing issues which can double (or more) your transmission times. Generally, tracking the Submarine Cable Map and placing servers near the large cable landing points provides good results. Still, it is important to pay attention to the following: </p>
								<p><ul>
									<li>ALWAYS and REGULARLY test your routes: If there is one thing to take away from this section, its that packets are more often routed in "surprising" ways than not. Modern routing is almost always least-cost, not least-time, and even hosts which attempt to be smarter often fail thanks to lack of visibility. The only way to ensure your packets are not going around the globe twice before getting to their destination is to compare the latency listed in debug.log with the speed of light between your two servers (you should expect transmission of just under two times the speed of light, in the ideal case).</li>
									<li>When using traceroute, looking at reverse DNS records for hosts outside of mainland China generally provides a reliable location mapping. eg ae-0.r22.asbnva02.us.bb.gin.ntt.net is in ASBurn, VA, US on NTT's network, pccw-gw-cr1.lax05.ipv4.pccwbtn.net is in Los Angeles (airport code LAX) on PCCW's network.</li>
									<li>Do not trust traceroute! While tracerotue is an incredibly useful tool for debugging routing issues, there are many reasons why it lies more often than not. Many links on the internet exist below the IP layer, meaning a packet going from Singapore to London will often only show one hop in traceroute, despite passing through routers in Mumbai, Suez, Marseille and Paris first. Sometimes traceroutes even show completely false paths when providers route different types of traffic through different routers.</li>
									<li>Smaller hosts are quite often willing to change their routing table for you! If your packets are taking a roundabout path to their destination and the host has alternate paths available, try asking their support to change the path preference for the IP ranges in question.</li>
									<li>Routing Within Southeast Asia is awful: Within Southeast Asia and Australia, it is incredibly common for packets to be routed through Los Angeles before making their way back across the Pacific to their destination. Test your routes before committing to servers long-term and re-test them regularly as routing changes all the time.</li>
									<li>Routing between Western Europe and Southeast Asia, by default, almost always goes through the US, adding significant delays and loss to packet delivery. There are two options to address this issue:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Routes out of Singapore are often sane: normally taking one of the many paths via Mumbai, Suez, and Marseilles. Sadly, this route is rather slow, and for data originating in Japan can even be slower than the normal US route.</li>
										<li>The fastest route from Japan/China and most of Southeast Asia to Western Europe, by far, is via the TEA Cable Network. However, it is incredibly rare to find two reasonably-priced hosts in Europe and Southeast Asia which will route using it. However, most hosts will route using it to servers in Siberia which sit on the Rostelecom network. Since there is little use for a full Bitcoin node in Siberia, a simple UDP-echo program is included as src/udp-echo.cpp (with build instructions at the top of the file). It can be used by placing it on a server and pointing it to two FIBRE nodes, between which it will forward packets. The process of actually buying hosting in Siberia is left as an exercise for the reader (seriously, can Bitcoin fix this damned siloed financial networks problem already?)</li>
